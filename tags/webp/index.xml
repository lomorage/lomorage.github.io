&lt;p>Lomorage is free private photo cloud solution that puts you in control of your photos and videos. To get best user experience among different platforms, such as iOS, Android, web, it utilizes smaller size thumbnail image to allow the clients to load image faster initially.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time, unlike desktop applications, mobile clients have limited storage, and a good mobile application should take it into consideration and provide better user experience while require system resources as little as possible. Thus, we need a image format which has better compression performance and is widely adopted by majority browsers and native clients.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
