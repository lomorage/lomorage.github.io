If you are running self-hosted service like Lomorage at home, and you are outside and want to access Lomorage, then you can use NPS.
However NPS need to run somewhere with public access, there are lots of service providers there, fly.io has a free plan without binding any credit card, and it supports docker deployment, and the servers runs in datacenters around the world so that the service can be deployed close to the users.</description></item><item><title>PhotoPrism meets Lomorage: The best Google Photos alternative</title><link>http://lomorage.com/blog/2022/02/11/photoprism/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Feb 2022 10:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://lomorage.com/blog/2022/02/11/photoprism/</guid><description>&lt;p>PhotoPrism is an Open Source AI Photo Management tool, and it works very well along with Lomorage.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Turn your old android tablet to lomorage photo frame</title><link>http://lomorage.com/blog/2021/08/26/zero-cost-android-frame/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 Aug 2021 10:38:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://lomorage.com/blog/2021/08/26/zero-cost-android-frame/</guid><description>&lt;p>I have and old android tablet at home, how to turn it to as photo frame to display my pictures?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Run Lomoage Docker in Windows 10</title><link>http://lomorage.com/blog/2020/11/16/windows-docker/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Nov 2020 22:43:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://lomorage.com/blog/2020/11/16/windows-docker/</guid><description>&lt;p>Though Lomorage already provide Windows Native MSI package, But if you like to run Docker image in Windows, please follow below steps to do so.
